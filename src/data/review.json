She teaches yoga with emphasis on awareness and breath and that helped me tremendously. My back ache was gone within a week and other pains reduced a lot. I enjoy her classes as she is punctual, knowledgeable and connects quickly with each participant. She is a gem. I am glad I found her. "

With her personalized care and instructions I got good relief. Deepali has lots of patience and answers of any kind of questions with smile and patience even if you ask the same repeatedly. She not only teaches the asanas but also explains the purpose of each of them. I have a very good experience with her and definitely recommend her to any one. "
